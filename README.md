# 🌐 Scalable and Secure Multi-Tier Web Application Infrastructure

## ✨ Overview of My Project

In this project, I successfully deployed a scalable and secure multi-tier web application on AWS using Terraform. Demonstrating deep expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud services, network security, and CI/CD processes was a paramount achievement for me.

## 🛠 Key Components I Implemented

### 🌍 VPC Configuration
I defined a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets across multiple availability zones, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance for the application.

### 🚀 EC2 Instances
I used EC2 instances to host both the application and database servers. Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) for the application layer were leveraged by me to ensure scalability based on traffic.

### 🗄 RDS Database
I placed an RDS instance in the private subnet for the database layer, enhancing the security posture of our environment.

### ⚖️ Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
I utilized an ELB to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances in the application layer, which enhanced availability and fault tolerance.

### 📦 S3 Bucket
I set up an S3 bucket for storing application logs and backups, ensuring proper access policies were in place for top-notch security.

### 🔑 IAM Roles and Policies
I defined IAM roles and policies for secure access management to AWS services, ensuring that only authorized users could access specific resources.

### 🔒 Security Groups and NACLs
I implemented security groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to define fine-grained ingress and egress rules, fortifying the network security.

### 🌐 Route 53
I employed Route 53 for DNS management and to implement a health-checked DNS failover strategy, guaranteeing reliability.

### 🚀 CloudFront
I deployed Amazon CloudFront as a CDN to cache content at edge locations, significantly reducing latency for end-users.

### 📊 Monitoring and Alerts
I set up CloudWatch for monitoring the infrastructure and application performance. Using CloudWatch Alarms, I was notified of any metrics threshold breaches, allowing me to react swiftly to potential issues.

### 🧩 Terraform Modules
I organized the infrastructure as code into reusable modules for VPC, EC2, RDS, etc., showcasing my ability to write clean, maintainable code.

### ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
I integrated the project with a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or Jenkins) for automated testing and deployment of Terraform code, streamlining the development process.

### 🔄 Terraform Backend
I configured a Terraform backend using S3 and DynamoDB for state management to enable efficient team collaboration.

### 🖥 Terraform Workspaces
I utilized Terraform workspaces to manage different environments (development, staging, production) efficiently, allowing for seamless deployment across various stages.

### 🔐 Encryption
I implemented encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for sensitive data stored in S3 and RDS, ensuring that data confidentiality is never compromised.

### 📈 Auto Scaling Policies
I configured dynamic scaling policies for EC2 Auto Scaling Groups based on CPU utilization and network traffic, ensuring that the application could handle varying loads gracefully.
